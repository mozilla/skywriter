+# Skywriter 1.0 Spec #
+
+## Introduction ##
+
+The Bespin project has shifted focus based on our needs within Mozilla and 
+things that we've learned. From the perspective of the Mozilla
+Developer Tools group, what we really need out of the project today is a
+powerful, user-friendly, customizable code editor component. This is 
+what we've been building with our Bespin Embedded packages.
+
+As of a few months ago, we still intended to create Desktop and Server
+versions of the editor. However, our need for those is less important to
+us than our need for great developer tools.
+
+Looking forward as Bespin matures from the Bespin project to 
+Mozilla Skywriter 1.0, we have this narrowed focus. This gives us leeway
+to greatly simplify things based on what we've learned and the new goals.
+Additionally, we have found that we have similar goals for Skywriter as
+Ajax.org does for the ACE editor component and that Ajax.org's Cloud9
+IDE has a lot in common with what we wanted to see the Bespin server become.
+
+At the high level, our plan is to merge Mozilla Skywriter and ACE. Skywriter
+1.0 will be based on this merged codebase. This document is here to collect
+up notes about how this merger will work and what the end product will look
+like.
+
+## Source Repositories ##
+
+As of this writing, our source repositories are in a bit of a funny state.
+We've done a good deal of work creating a new plugin structure and altering
+Skywriter plugins to fit this structure. That work is in a "shared"
+repository that we had created originally to hold code shared between the 
+projects. That repository is here:
+
+https://github.com/mozilla/cloud9-skywriter-shared
+
+Right now, that repository includes its own copy of ACE, right in that
+repository. This will need to change.
+
+The authoritative repository for ACE is here:
+
+https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace
+
+The authoritative repository for Skywriter is here:
+
+https://github.com/mozilla/skywriter
+
+At present, the Skywriter repository doesn't have much that has migrated
+forward toward 1.0.
+
+In the immediate term, Mozilla will create a fork of the ACE repository.
+The Skywriter repository will have this fork as a submodule. The code
+in the shared repository will either move into the ACE repository or the
+Skywriter repository, depending on whether it's likely to be useful
+to ACE/Cloud9.
+
+Once Ajax.org is ready to move over to the updated-with-new-plugin-system ACE,
+the submodule in Skywriter will change to point to the authoritative ACE
+repository.
